# zkPass-Node 
zkPass-Node is the server side implementation of zkPass protocol.
It performs multi-party secure computing, and can obtain protocol revenue by contributing verification computing power.

## Main Technologies

### **Multi-party computation**
Give users the ability to prove to third parties the provenance of such data. The specific implementation of this project, is based on:
- ECtF: Converting shares in EC(Fp) to shares in Fp
- GC: FreeXor + Half-Gates  (Stacked Garbling/Three Halves make a whole)
- OT: IKNP03 + KOS15 (Silent OT)

### **Zero-knowledge proofs**
Refer to the ability of a prover to convince a verifier that an assertion is correct without providing any useful information to the verifier.
The specific implementation of this project is based on the PLONK algorithm.
